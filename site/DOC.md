## What is this and usage
Want to make your own blog in under 30-minutes? Just follow our easy steps and get your new blog ready in minute!<br>
While I developed this full project in 8 hours (of 3 days). On the 3rd day, I finally added posts to posts index. So from the 3rd day, I got sucess! I also tried this 1 week ago to develop, But I got fail. I do my all full mind on this, And finally I seen @somePythonProgrammer's website. His blog theme is really awesome. I asked to him that can I add to my project, So he accepted, So the project is here! ;)<br>

## Setting up
> **Warning: You must be have python installed to use this blog maker.**<br>
> No more packages are required. Simply Python.


To setup your blog, Download the zip file from this github repository. Extract it. And then you got it set up!

## Adding Posts to Blog
Its just simple! Just as in the folder, there have a file 'add_blog_post.py'. Run it and follow the steps from the screen or here:

It will ask you for Post Title. Type the title of the post you want. Then Type a little description, Like a slogan. Then next type the description of your full post. Then finally type the id. The id will be the name of the file and also in the url. We recomeneed that you should not include spaces in the ide. Also don't leave the ide blank. Leaving blank will can broke the post and can get conflicts.

That's it! If you see 'There are no posts posted by the admin', So reload the page. If the problem persists, please contact me.

> **Warning: Please don't use blog-post, index, or posts text as the id. Doing it so will corrupt the blog.**


## Deleting a post
It might be hard to delete a post for you, as it is not easier for you, But developer know.

Open site/posts.html and under the center#index element, find the post element and delete it. Then you can also delete the file from explorer on that path. But if you don't, so there by random pages, some users can still access the un-linked and hidden pages in your site.

## What to share for your blog?
If you want to share your blog's source, Share all the files under the 'site' folder. But you can leave the following files, If you share only the site folder:
* DOC.md
* blog-post.html

These are 2 files, that you can leave by default if you share the site folder.
